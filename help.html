                <a href="">Put up some data</a>
                    There are many ways of doing this. The web needs both raw data -- fresh hypertext or old plain text files, or smart servers giving views of existing databases. See <a href="">more details</a> , <a href="">etiquette</a>. 
                Suggest someone else does
                    Maybe you know a system which it would be neat to have on the web. How about suggesting to the person involved that they put up a W3 server?
